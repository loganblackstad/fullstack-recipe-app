## Features

- **Clean, intuitive design** — With Blog & Comment, all blog posts are displayed on a centered page with optimal use of whitespace for readability. Inspired by [Medium's](https://medum.com/), Blog & Comment is responsive, so it looks great on tablets, phones, and even in print.

- **Everything on a single page** — Gone are the days when your users had to paginate through a million pages to find fresh content. Blog & Comment puts all content on a single page. We haven't sacrificed linkability, though. As you scroll, your browser's hash will update to the nearest header, so linking to a particular point in the documentation is still natural and easy.

- **Secure Login** — Lorem Ipsum
